Here be the rules:

The computer will play a 4 digit number which you have to guess. If you guess any number contained in the 4 digits, you score a cow.
In the event that you score a number that's in the same position then you score a bull. The game wins when you score 4 bulls.

For example, if the computer generates '1234' and you guess '4356' you will score 2 cows and 0 bulls, as 4 and 3 are in the number
but you did not guess the correct positioning. Now if you guess '1238', you score 3 cows and 3 bulls, as you guessed 3 numbers correctly
in the right position.
